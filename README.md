== Description ==

Lora is a simple and elegant theme built on HTML5 & CSS3. It's based on the Quark starter theme, so that means not only is it flexible, it's extremely easy to customise.

If you do decide to use a child theme with Lora, there's no need to use CSS @import or even enqueue the parent stylesheet. Lora will automatically enqueue the parent stylesheet for you. How nice is that!

Lora's base is a responsive, 12 column grid. It uses Normalize to make sure that browsers render all elements more consistently and Mordernizr for detecting HTML5 and CSS3 browser capabilities along with some default stylings from HTML5 Boilerplate.

It incorporates the Option Framework(http://wptheming.com/options-framework-theme/) by Devin Price and the gorgeous [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon font by Dave Gandy.

The main navigation uses the standard WordPress menu. Support for dropdown menus is inluded by default. If you'd like to envoke a button toggle for the main navigation menu on small screens, simply uncomment the two lines from the lora_scripts_styles() function within functions.php to register and enqueue the necessary javascript file, and you're done!

If you're looking to build an eCommerce website, Lora supports WooCommerce. When WooCommerce is activated, an extra tab is displayed within the Theme Options page that provides options to show or hide the sidebar on the default WooCommerce templates, along with the choice to remove the built-in WooCommerce breadcrumbs.

Templates

Lora includes a set of your most common theme templates, including templates for Full-Width pages, Left Sidebar, Right Sidebar (default), Front-Page, Tag, Categories, Authors, Search, Posts Archive and 404.

If you're using one of the many page builder plugins that are available, such as Visual Composer, Beaver Builder, Divi Builder or the SiteOrigin Page Builder, try using the Page Builder Full-Width Template or the Page Builder Boxed Template. The Page Builder Full-Width Template is a true full browser width template while the Page Builder Boxed Template contains your content in a boxed layout. If you want a completely blank full-width page with no header or footer sections, such as for a landing page, then there is also a Page Builder Blank Template. Depending which Page Builder plugin that you're using, you may find that one template provides a better layout than the other.

Post Formats

All the standard WordPress Post Formats are supported. These include; Aside, Gallery, Link, Image, Quote, Status, Video, Audio, Chat and of course, your standard post.

Widgets

Widgets are a great way of adding extra content to your site and Lora has a whole assortment of them.

Main Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on posts and pages except the optional Homepage template, which has its own widgets

Single Post Sidebar: Appears in the sidebar on single posts only

The Front Page Banner Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to two of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you only add widgets into the First Front Page Banner Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to both Front Page Banner Widget areas, they'll magically space themselves out over two equal columns.
First Front Page Banner Widget: Appears in the banner area on the Front Page

The Front Page Widget areas are dynamic! You can use up to four of these and they'll magically space themselves out evenly. For example, if you only add widgets into the First Front Page Widget Area, then it will expand the full width of the page. However, if you add widgets to all four Front Page Widget Areas, they'll magically space themselves out over four equal columns.
First Homepage Widget Area: Appears when using the optional homepage template with a page set as Static Front Page
